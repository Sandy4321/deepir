Using unsupervised deep learning within sub-groups as the input for Bayesian discrimination. 

Everything in here is built around the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) library for python.  See the demo at [deepir.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/taddylab/deepir/blob/master/deepir.ipynb).
